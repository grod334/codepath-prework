## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My 3 favorite apps are:

1. Gmail

   My Favorite feature of Gmail is labels. Labels allows the user to organize emails into categories. These categories can be the default categories or the user can
   customize their own.
   
2. ESPN

   My favorite features on the ESPN app is the video highlights and favorites. As soon as the user opens the app, a video of the top sports highlights plays instantly.
   For the favorite section, ESPN shows the user specific news and score updates from your favorite team.
   
3. YouTube

   I like the autoplay feature. I enjoy watching basketball highlights and this feature is great for basketball clips. I can scroll through all of the videos
   without clicking on the video. Its fast and easy to switch videos. Also, once you click on a video, an ad will popup. When I watch highlights, I strictly use
   the autoplay feature so I can view them without ads.
   

   The app I use most is the messenger app. The messenger app has a feature where people can react to a text with a heart, thumbs up, haha, and others. I think it would be interested to add a feature where the user could click on a button that would give them the stats related to these reactions. For example, which text got the most replies, laughs, or thumbs down. I think it would be interesting to get a year in review for group chats where the user gets some kind of stats for reactions, sharing pictures, sharing links, etc.


## Notes

Challenges that I encountered.

I had the most trouble with the gif walkthrough. At first, I couldnt figure out how to get my gif to display in my readme file. I googled how to do it and after looking
at a couple resources, I figured out how to do it.
